## What is an open company?

An **open company** is defined, for the purposes of this list, as a for-profit organization whose practices are guided primarily by the principles of openness, transparency and interoperability, to create value for its customers and user community as a main goal, and profit as a consequence, rather than the other way around. The core principles can be summarized by the maxim:

> **Share as much as possible, charge as little as possible.**

derived from the [original formulation](http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company/) by Gittip.

In practice, this often means:
- releasing its products as
  [free and open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
  [open content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content),
  or [open source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)
- using [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard)
  and [inter-operable formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability)
- developing its products openly, using public communication channels
- publishing as much financial and operational data as possible, without compromising customer privacy.
- etc.
